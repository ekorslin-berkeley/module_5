Do people who earn less money annually tend to utilize high-end restaurant experience coupons with more frequency than those who earn more?  Do recipients of coupons for bar experiences tend to utlize them more when they are accompanied by a fried or signifant other?  If you find yourself asking questions like this, you are in the exact right place! 

Funny enough, research shows that, contrary to assumption, those who earn less annually do not ulitilize coupons for discounted dining experiences at more expensive establishments than their higher earning counterparts.  Too, research finds that those who receive coupons to head spontaneously for a local bar/restaurant establishment are more likely to do so if they are accompanied by a friend of significant other upon receipt of the coupon offer.  Further, those who receive an offer for discounted bar experiences are far more likely to accept & redeem the offers if they show a history of visiting similar establishments in the recent past.
